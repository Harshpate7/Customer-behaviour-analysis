# User Behavior Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze user behavior and purchasing patterns using SQL for data preparation and Tableau for interactive visualizations. The insights derived from this analysis can help in understanding customer demographics, purchase trends, and product preferences.

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize user behavior, focusing on demographic and purchasing patterns.
- **Data Source**: Transactional and user demographic data.
- **Key Areas of Analysis**:
  - Identifying missing or inconsistent values in key data columns.
  - Understanding user demographics (age, gender, country).
  - Analyzing purchase trends based on date, category, and amount.

## SQL Analysis Highlights

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Addressed null values in critical columns like `age`, `gender`, `country`, `purchase_amount`, `purchase_date`, and `product_category`.

2. **User Demographics**:
   - Filtered and analyzed data to understand customer distribution by age, gender, and country.

3. **Purchase Trends**:
   - Evaluated purchase behavior over time and across product categories.
   - Identified high-spending customers and popular categories.

## Tableau Dashboard Features

The interactive Tableau dashboard provides visual insights into:

1. **Demographics**:
   - Distribution of users by age group, gender, and country.
   
2. **Purchasing Trends**:
   - Time-based purchase patterns.
   - Popular product categories and their sales performance.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - High-value customers and their purchasing behavior.
